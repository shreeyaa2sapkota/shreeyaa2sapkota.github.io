### CPSC 120

[LAB 2](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-02-shreeyaa2sapkota)

Among all the labs we completed, Lab 2 is one of my favorites because it marked the beginning of our path toward studying computer science. I acquired all the fundamental knowledge required to perform several lab projects through this lab. It was also from this lab that I started using GitHub.

As someone who has always loved word games, it was really fun working on part 1 of this lab as we had to write a program that completes sentences. The most crucial component of this lab, and one of the reasons I'm here, was to create code since by the time we finished lab 2, we were more familiar with all other basic stuff. It was really enjoyable to fill in the blanks with all the different foods I enjoy in sandwiches as I tested my output. I learned how to declare std::string variables and work with them to acquire the expected output.

Part 1 of Lab 12 is one of my favorites as it was about making animation. I was quite delighted when I saw the assignment since it is the first animation I have produced since the beginning of this session. I was using the sine function for the first time, so I was learning how to work with it which made the work feel even more interesting.
